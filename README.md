A simple POC for "meta-event" calendar. App shows what events will occur within given time period and how much time is until the event.

Site allows uploading of iCal calendars by URL. App uses Google FireStore as database. Idea is to separate iCal calendars and the app calendars so app calendars can be personalized and modified separately from original calendars.

-  (at least) Google login: Add private calendars with eg. family birthdays 
-  Editing calendars: add personalized description for what you need to remember about some event, hide or add events to calendar
-  Sharing: Create new calendars and share them in public
-  Copy public calendars: Copy other Remember app calendars and personalize them
